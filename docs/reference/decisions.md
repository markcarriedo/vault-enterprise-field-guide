## 2026-09-09 — Deploy via HashiCorp's official HVD module, not a hand-rolled Terraform config

**Context:** Need to stand up Vault Enterprise on AWS EC2. Could write our own Terraform from
scratch, or use HashiCorp's published [Validated Design module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault-enterprise-hvd)
(`hashicorp/vault-enterprise-hvd/aws`), which encodes HashiCorp's own recommended reference
architecture (ASG, NLB, IAM, Integrated Storage/Raft, KMS auto-unseal).

**Decision:** Use the HVD module. We're responsible for the prerequisite infrastructure it
expects (VPC/subnets, KMS key, Secrets Manager entries for license + TLS material) and for
supplying its required inputs; the module itself owns the Vault EC2/ASG/LB/IAM resources.

**Alternatives considered:** Hand-rolled Terraform — more control, but means re-deriving
HashiCorp's own reference architecture decisions (instance sizing, seal config, listener setup)
instead of starting from a maintained, HashiCorp-authored baseline.

**Consequences:** Our own Terraform is scoped to the four prerequisites, not the Vault
infrastructure itself. Any deviation from the module's supported inputs (see
[deployment customizations](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault-enterprise-hvd/blob/main/docs/vault-deployment-customizations.md))
needs to go through its variables rather than editing generated resources directly.
